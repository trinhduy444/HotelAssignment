# Assignment README

Currently, I have not completed this assignment as I started quite late, and this task is not as easy as I initially thought.

### Solution Overview

1. First, I will add all hotel-related data into a single object.
2. Then, I will merge the data to extract the necessary and complete information.
3. Finally, I will format the structure to meet the requirements specified in the assignment.

I am continuing to work on improving and finalizing the solution.

### Request for Extension

I hope that Ascenda could give me an additional 1-2 days. With my current capabilities, I believe I can complete this assignment within that time.

Thank you for reading
